Task 1: arrayManipulation.js
- Within this file, there are two functions. The initial function, named "processArray," which processes an array of numbers by squaring even numbers and tripling odd numbers, producing a new array.

Task 2:
- The second function within arrayManipulation.js, called "formatArrayStrings," operates on two arrays: one containing strings and the other numbers processed by the "processArray" function. It adjusts each string according to its corresponding number, capitalizing the entire string for even numbers and converting it to lowercase for odd numbers.

Task 3: userInfo.js
- Inside this file, there exists a function named "createUserProfiles," which accepts an array of names and the modified names array generated from "arrayManipulation.js". It outputs an array of objects, each comprising originalName, modifiedName, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1.
